# RescueTime Efficiency Indicator

* A simple applet that shows your current efficiency score according to [Rescuetime](http://www.rescuetime.com)
* Each hour-ish your efficiency score changes, according to how you waste your time.
* This applet connects to your profile and retrieves the score and puts it in your traybar

# Usage

As of the last (and only) version, you need to put your Rescuetime API key inside a file called apikey,
located on the same folder as rescuescore.py.

Tested currently only on Linux (Mint 15 Olivia Cinnamon).

Written in Python with no external dependencies beside GTK/Cairo/rescuetime.
